# Retinal-Layers-segmentation-to-analyzie-retinal-anomalies
Retinal abnormalities are the second big reason of blindness after Cataract. A retinal disease affects one or more retinal layers so, in order to analyze the retinal abnormality ophthalmologist needs to extract retinal layers correctly. Manual extraction is currently used but it is a time-consuming process. So, in this paper we proposed a deep learning based automated algorithm for semantic segmentation of retinal layers. We have used a fully convolutional neural network similar to UNet architecture. The proposed algorithm has been trained and tested on publically available Mendeley Dataset of Optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans.
